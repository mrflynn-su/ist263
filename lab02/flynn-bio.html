        <h1>Mikayla Flynn's Biography</h1> 
        <p>My name is Mikayla Flynn and I am majoring in Information Management and Technologies. My concentration is in web design so I am interested in learning about how websites are designed and the creative components behind creating a website.  I am also interested in information security so I want to learn more about how data is protected on websites and what can be done to prevent hackers from attacking.</p>
        <p>I have learned a lot about Python from <strong> IST 256 </strong> so I am familiar with the coding side of websites. I have also become very familiar with a lot of Microsoft applications and how to use them throughout my time at Syracuse University.</p>
        <p>Another skill of mine is that I am a leader, I have had to become a leader in many of the jobs and roles that I have held throughout high school and college.</p>
